# **Personal Project (OOP Car Program)**

This is a detailed timeline of what will be completed in my personal project, which I chose to be developing an OOP Car Program written in the Java language.

1.  First, I will create an interface named Chassis with a public constant string and it will include set and get methods. 

Solution: After creating the interface named Chassis, I created a string constant named chassis and gave it the value of "Chassis". 
Code: public final String chassis = "Chassis";
    
2.  Next, I will create an engine interface with the given list of public method definition that return void.
    
4.  Next, I will create a concrete class named VehicleChassis that implements the chassis interface.
    
5.  Then, I will create a concrete class named VehicleFtame that implememts the chassis interface.
    
6.  Next, I will create a concrtete class named ManufacturedEngine that will implement th engine interface.
    
7.  Next, I will creat a feature interface with the given method defintions.
    
8.  Next, a concrete class named InteriorFeature will be created that implements tha feature interface.
    
9.  Next, I will create a concrete class named ExteriorFeature that will impllement the feature interface.
    
10.  Next, I will create a concrete class named vehicle that implements the engine and chassis interfaces with the given requirements.
    
11.  After, I will create a concrete class named Car that extends the vehicle class with its given requirements
