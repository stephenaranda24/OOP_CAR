# **Personal Project (OOP Car Program)**


## Author: Stephen Aranda

This is a detailed timeline of what will be completed in my personal project, which I chose to be developing an OOP Car Program written in the Java language.

1.  First, I will create an interface named Chassis with a public constant string and it will include set and get methods. 
    
3.  Next, I will create an engine interface with the given list of public method definition that return void.
    
4.  Next, I will create a concrete class named VehicleChassis that implements the chassis interface.
    
5.  Then, I will create a concrete class named VehicleFrame that implememts the chassis interface.
    
6.  Next, I will create a concrtete class named ManufacturedEngine that will implement the engine interface.
    
7.  Next, I will create a feature interface with the given method defintions.
    
8.  Next, a concrete class named InteriorFeature will be created that implements that feature interface.
    
9.  Next, I will create a concrete class named ExteriorFeature that will impllement the feature interface.
    
10.  Next, I will create a concrete class named vehicle that implements the engine and chassis interfaces with the given requirements.
    
11.  After, I will create a concrete class named Car that extends the vehicle class with its given requirements

Sprint 1

_Starting the Project_

**Week 1:**
Define a **constructor**: A constructor is a special kind of method that creates an instance of a class.

Define the **Final** keyword: It makes the variable it is assigned to a constant and if it is applied to a method, then that method cannot be overridden.

Define an **immutable Class**:  An immutable class is a class that cannot be sub-classed.

Define an **interface**: An interface is a kind of class that defines constants and methods *without* implementations. It is like a "contract" for the methods.

**Week 2:**

In this week I created the Chassis interface. I learned how to create an interface and how to implement the methods that are written in the interface.

**Week 3:**

In this week I created the interface named Engine, this interface contained all the necessary mutator methods.

**Week 4:**

In this week I created the concrete class named VehicleChassis, it implemented the Chassis interface. When writing the getChassisType method I learned how to return an instance of the interface by using the *this* keyword.

**Week 5:**

In this week I created the concrete class named VehicleFrame that implements the Chassis interface.

Sprint 2
*Midpoint*

**Week 6:**

In this week I created the concrete class named ManufacturedEngine. I learned that the importance of the order of the fields inside of a constructor is very important when calling that constructor. 

**Week 7:**

In this week I created an interface named Feature with their method defintions. I noticed that interfaces are like "contracts" for methods.

**Week 8:**

In this week, I created the concrete class named InteriorFeature that implements the Feature interface and its methods.

**Week 9:**

In this week, I created the concrete class named ExteriorFeature which implements the Feature interface.

## 

Sprint 3
*End Game*

**Week 10:**

In this week, I created another concrete class named Vehicle which both the Engine and the Chassis interfaces along with their methods.
I learned through the week how overloaded constructors work in detail along with the default constructor.

**Week 11:**
In this week, I created the concrete class named Car that extends the Vehicle class. The for loops for the toString method in this class would have taken me a while to figure out at the beginning of the project, but at this point I made the loop with ease. I then submitted my project on repl.it for confirmation and it passed all tests. Prepared for submission.
